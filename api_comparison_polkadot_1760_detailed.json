No curation fees. Curation and management of this bounty will be submitted to the bounty itself on a per-task or per-project basis.  \n**Curators:** Michael M\u00fcller, Parity Technologies, Polytope Labs, R0GUE, Virto.  \n**Short Description**: The purpose of this bounty is to ensure ink\\! remains the flagship native Rust smart contract language of Polkadot by finalizing, auditing, and launching ink\\! v6 on PolkaVM, while continuously maintaining, and optimizing the ecosystem. The bounty will cover currently identified tasks such as audit remediation, ink\\! v6 release, tooling improvements, tutorials, and hackathons, while also providing flexibility to fund future needs like ongoing SDK compatibility, performance optimization, and readiness for the Hub launch. ink\\! will be the first competitive smart contract language on PolkVM.\n**Full Proposal Document**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Brl7EJEjQ02sV8yy9PhWAuI-2_YkGrSaAs8t-obgEGE/edit?tab=t.0\n\n![Group 44.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSNpRzp5E5gHk1VA237DANrAx4dga7JyK7z8KTRujhyQW)\n\n## 1\\. ink\\! Alliance Executive Summary & Update\n\nSince the [initial proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1123), the ink\\! Alliance extended the funds to twelve months, twice the planned six, delivering on its objectives, and much more. This was achieved by deliberately keeping the developer count lower, a decision made in light of PolkaVM and Polkadot Hub delays outside the Alliance\u2019s control. Rather than scale prematurely, resources were focused on high-impact work, ensuring steady progress and extending the lifetime of available funds. This approach has been validated by [OG Tracker](https://app.ogtracker.io/mediumSpender/1123?tab=progress), with a full outline of deliverables provided below. A full budget breakdown can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B-qry5Vv8yDBYsOGR4_t0J8Q7W9w3eUf7DyzHl9mZIg/edit?gid=706080196#gid=706080196).\n\n### **1.1. From Proposal to Bounty in Preparation for Polkadot Hub**\n\nWith Polkadot Hub nearing launch, the Alliance proposes restructuring under a bounty model. This ensures both accountability and the flexibility needed to align ink\\!\u2019s development, education, and community support with the Hub\u2019s evolving needs. \n\nAs the only language presently capable of bringing PolkaVM to market in December, ink\\! requires a funding model that secures launch readiness while remaining adaptable in preparation for the Hub's launch and ongoing support.\n\nThis bounty goes beyond hitting the launch milestone. Rust\u2019s safety and performance, combined with ink\\!\u2019s deep Polkadot SDK integration, uniquely position it to highlight Polkadot\u2019s strengths. By showcasing cross-chain dApps, boosting performance, and refining tooling, ink\\! will be both launch-ready and the clear choice for next-generation smart contracts on Polkadot.\n\n**What makes ink\\! different and why it matters now**\n\n* **XCM-first:** Native SDK integration makes cross-chain calls easier and safer, lowering time-to-mainnet for multi-chain dApps and directly showcasing Polkadot\u2019s unique interoperability.  \n* **Performance:** Smaller binaries, lower gas, and better ergonomics unlock advanced use-cases that are impractical in other languages.  \n* **Rust talent pool:** With \\~5.1M+ Rust developers worldwide, growing enterprise adoption, and proven success of Rust-based smart contract ecosystems elsewhere, ink\\! massively expands the Hub\u2019s ability to attract builders.  \n* **Rich Rust ecosystem:** ink\\! inherits Rust\u2019s vast library of crates, tooling, and frameworks, giving developers immediate access to ready-to-use components.  \n* **Compiler-level security:** Rust prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time, reducing vulnerabilities and increasing safety for on-chain code.  \n* **Developer confidence:** The strict type and ownership model makes common pitfalls impossible, raising confidence in shipping production-ready contracts faster.\n\n### **1.2. Achievements**\n\nIn the last funding cycle (Oct 2024 \\- Sept 2025 inclusive), the ink\\! Alliance delivered significant advancement to the ecosystem\u2019s technical capabilities, including:\n\n**ink\\! v5**\n\n* Released ink\\! v5.1 with new features such as XCM support.  \n* Completed a full and highly successful [security audit](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/ink-alliance-six-month-progress-update/12196) of v5 by SRLabs and Parity Security.  \n* Maintaining ink\\! v5, running on pallet-contracts/WebAssembly.   \n* Publishing new minor releases for v5 and fixing community reported bugs.\n\n**ink\\! v6**\n\n* Full migration from pallet-contracts/Wasm to pallet-revive/PolkaVM.  \n* [Solidity ABI support](https://medium.com/@r0gue/ink-solidity-abi-on-polkavm-c675c854efd3), enabling ink\\!/Solidity interoperability. Developers can now also use existing Solidity tooling directly with ink\\! contracts, while still benefiting from PolkaVM\u2019s performance and security. This enables the usage of MetaMask and Solidity frontend libraries (like ethers.js) with ink\\! contracts.  \n* Extensive testing pipeline for PolkaVM & pallet-revive, uncovering upstream bugs.  \n* ink\\! tooling support (cargo-contract, Contracts UI, etc.) upgraded for PolkaVM readiness.\n\nNotably, Solidity ABI compatibility was not part of the original scope and represents additional value delivered to the ecosystem.\n\n**Education & Onboarding**\n\n* **Website & Docs Overhaul:** The Alliance worked closely with [Flez](https://x.com/iamflez) and [Niftesty](https://x.com/niftesty) to rebuild the entire [use.ink](https://use.ink/) site, refreshed documentation, and redesigned learning materials, dramatically improving the onboarding experience for new developers.  \n* **Active Social Presence:** ink\\!\u2019s voice across [@ink\\_lang](https://x.com/ink_lang) and community channels continues to grow, driving awareness, showcasing success stories, and making ink\\! the recognized Polkadot-native contract language.  \n* **Sub0 Reset (Oct \u201924):** The team [showcased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3nlshPg_U&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGvdRewAQMfkEYBM_ZkOYMIr&index=31) novel cross-chain contract functionality with ink\\! and messaging, showing developers how to compose services across parachains.   \n* **Hackathon at Sub0 Reset (Oct \u201924):** The Alliance also ran the ink\\! v5 dApp track at the [WebZero Blockspace](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/theblockspace-sub0/detail), creating hands-on [challenges](https://github.com/r0gue-io/sub0-ink-challenges) to onboard builders and collect feedback for v6. During the competition the team reviewed and provided feedback on [43 challenge submissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxmjUAK-HOqQxzjSXWFGewTfsyW2Kq9Ang4XBADG4e0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.88ysfzyf899p).  \n* **Hackathon at Web3 Summit (Jul \u201825):** In collaboration with the ink\\!ubator, ink\\! v6 on PolkaVM was in developers\u2019 hands for the first time. Developers successfully built, tested, and deployed contracts on PAsset Hub. This milestone proved ink\\! is approaching production readiness and highlighted the need for smooth testnet cycles and integrated tooling. Read the full story [here](https://r0gue.medium.com/ink-at-the-web3summit-hackathon-8e9fd6ee0f79).  \n* **Community Workshops & Tutorials:** Delivered two tutorials for the Encode Club x Polkadot ink\\! Bootcamp, covering [Cross-Contract Calls on ink\\!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sxpDsbgs08) and [Creating Multi-Chain Contracts with ink\\!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sxpDsbgs08), in addition to a [DAO Workshop & AMA](https://x.com/EdgewareDAO/status/1843992429713830096) in collaboration with Edgeware.  \n* **Polkadot Blockchain Academy Bali (Sept \u201825):** The Alliance sent a tutor to train the latest wave of Polkadot developers in ink\\!, ensuring they graduated ready to build secure, performant, and composable contracts for Polkadot Hub and beyond.  \n* **ink\\! article published in CoinsBench (Sept \u201825):** [ink\\! speaks Solidity on PolkaVM](https://coinsbench.com/ink-solidity-abi-on-polkavm-c675c854efd3)\n\nSince the last funding round, the ink\\! Alliance has consolidated ecosystem contributions into [GitHub tracking issues](https://github.com/orgs/use-ink/projects/2), providing greater transparency and coordination across projects. \n\nBeyond its original mandate, the Alliance has made significant contributions to PolkaVM\u00b9, pallet-revive\u00b2, and alloy-rs\u00b3 strengthening the broader Polkadot SDK tooling landscape. Today, ink\\! operates what is likely the most extensive testing pipeline for both components, surfacing upstream issues.\n\n\u00b9 [\\[TRACKING\\] Contributions to polkavm](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-alliance/issues/24)  \n\u00b2 [\\[TRACKING\\] Contributions to pallet\\_revive](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-alliance/issues/23)  \n\u00b3 [\\[TRACKING\\] Contributions to alloy-rs](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-alliance/issues/74)\n\nOver the next six months, the Alliance will finalize ink\\! v6 with optimizations, finalise audit remediations, and accelerate adoption through education and developer engagement, ensuring Polkadot Hub launches with a mature, production-ready Rust smart contract language. Beyond the Hub launch window, the proposed bounty provides for continued maintenance, improvements, and ecosystem growth over the subsequent six months, ensuring ink\\! remains reliable, well-supported, and a cornerstone of Polkadot\u2019s smart contract strategy.\n\n## **2\\. ink\\! High Level Technical Status Summary**\n\n### **2.1. Current Status**\n\n* **ink\\! v5:** Audited, maintained with bug fixes and minor releases.  \n* **ink\\! v6:** Pre-release state, feature-complete for pallet-revive/PolkaVM.  \n* **Toolchain:** cargo-contract and Contracts UI updated for RISC-V execution.  \n  * DRink\\!: Core functionality is now native in ink\\!\u2019s e2e testing framework and will be deprecated going forward.  \n* **Docs & Tutorials:** Updated for new architecture, with community-driven improvements.  \n* **Ecosystem:** ink\\! is supported by numerous parachains including Phala, Peaq, Astar, Kreivo, and Polkadot Hub in the imminent future.\n\n**ink\\! v6 has not yet published v6 (only pre-releases) for the following reasons:**\n\n1) Work on pallet-revive is still ongoing, requiring additional development in ink\\! v6 following those changes.  \n2) ink\\! v6 has not yet been audited.\n\n## \u200b\u200b**3\\. Context of the Proposal**\n\nPolkadot is at a decisive moment. The Hub is preparing for its most important launch to date: a [dual smart contract platform](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/smart-contracts-on-polkadot-hub-progress-update/14596) that will support both EVM and PVM contracts. This strategy balances short-term traction with long-term innovation. On one side, Revm integration allows Solidity developers to deploy unchanged contracts with familiar tooling, unlocking immediate opportunities to onboard top-tier Ethereum dApps and infrastructure providers. On the other, PolkaVM is Polkadot\u2019s forward-looking, RISC-V powered engine for high-performance smart contracts and the foundation for next-generation applications.\n\nThis dual path is pragmatic, but also revealing. While EVM compatibility creates a fast lane for existing Web3 developer adoption, it is limited by the constraints of Solidity and the Ethereum model. PolkaVM is the future: faster execution, and the foundation for JAM. Launching the Hub with PolkaVM, ink\\! will be the first competitive language that can battle test and benefit from PolkaVM's improvements, and ensure that Polkadot doesn\u2019t just replicate Ethereum, but instead pioneers the next generation of smart contracts.\n\n**ink\\! is positioned to take PolkaVM to market in 2025\\.**  \nAt present there is only one language that can bring PolkaVM to market in 2025 on Polkadot Hub, that language is ink\\!. This will enable the Hub access to a developer pool that exceeds [5.1 million+](https://research.slashdata.co/reports/6814fddffed4a97023eab098/pages/10) Rust devs as of 2025, across every industry \\- including being [backed by Google](https://rustfoundation.org/media/google-contributes-1m-to-rust-foundation-to-support-c-rust-interop-initiative/). This constitutes a talent pool that is \\~191 times larger than all Web3 developers combined\u2074. Additionally, in the [2024 State of Rust Survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/13/2024-State-Of-Rust-Survey-results/), 45% of respondents reported that their organizations now make non-trivial use of Rust (up 7% from 2023\\) making it an excellent choice for enterprise adoption.\n\n\u2074 Electric Capital: [2024 Developer Report](https://www.developerreport.com/).\n\n**With this, ink\\! delivers secure enterprise-grade contracts for the Hub.**  \nFrom day one, ink\\! guarantees that developers can deploy secure, scalable contracts on Polkadot\u2019s native stack, without compromise. The proposition put forth in this proposal enables a reliable time-to-market for PolkaVM smart contract readiness on the Hub in 2025, reduces technical risk, and positions the Hub as a first mover with RISC-V smart contracts.\n\n### Full Document\nThe full proposal can be found here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Brl7EJEjQ02sV8yy9PhWAuI-2_YkGrSaAs8t-obgEGE/edit?tab=t.0.",

            "content": "## **Polkadot People Initiative: Incentives for Mass Polkadot Activation Campaign**\n\n### &#xA;**Proponent:**&#x20;\n\nPolkadot People System Chain (1rqM48LQVgWAsqgk35WqUVoqwQ7wyBf19Lkh3T4DeMvmmkE)\n\n**Requested funds:**\u00a0\n\nUSDT: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nUSDC: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nTotal: $3,009,600 these funds will be swapped to HOLLAR via DCA over 10 days.\n\n\n**Context:**\n\nSoon to be unveiled, Parity Technologies has spent 3 years designing and developing a Polkadot-native Proof-of-Personhood system. Project Individuality is autonomous logic which provides strong sybil-resistance worthy of our nascent Agentic Society. Sitting on the *Polkadot People* chain it is under Polkadot Governance and will be seamlessly integrated into both the upcoming Polkadot mobile application as well as Polkadot Hub. It is based on open standards and APIs and third-party integration is welcomed.\n\nThis specific proposal is to fund a massive Polkadot Induction campaign: the Fairest Airdrop ever and giving meaningful amounts to people outside of not only the Polkadot community but also outside of the wider crypto community. **No existing tokens, accounts or wallets are needed to take part.** The funding includes long-term incentives to ensure that our newcomers are retained within the Polkadot ecosystem as contributors to our wider services and success. Project Individuality, as new technology, can facilitate this campaign in a way unimaginable before.\n\nPolkadot needs a massive, technology-enabled, decentralised and secure incentivised user induction programme. These funds will be used for that incentive. Autonomous, on-chain logic will control and disbursement of these funds. **Neither Parity nor any other ecosystem entity has any role or authority in disbursement nor any operational function or privilege**. This logic will be in line with what is written here, reviewed and manifested by the standard Polkadot Governance apparatus and audited externally as is standard for system code.\n\n### The Spend\n\nThe funds will be disbursed under three separate and fully autonomous incentive mechanisms:\n\nFirstly, remuneration for the initial user bootstrapping, seeking to ensure that those individuals who come fastest and commit most to Polkadot People face no economic downside (and in some cases a modest economic upside). Individuals to receive $200, $100 or $50, depending on how early they are.\n\nSecondly, a pot for the continuous funding, paid exclusively and fairly, to Polkadot users who are both active and useful within the new Polkadot Governance apparatus. Individuals to receive no more than around $10/week again depending on contributions as measured through some game-theoretically sound, autonomous and decentralised means.\n\nFinally, the majority of the funds will go to a weekly airdrop system, aiming to randomly disburse small sums of money globally to lucky Polkadot People in a well-promoted airdrop campaign. Prizes of around $250, with special monthly star prizes which are $2,500. We expect to give away around 140 prizes per week, limiting the number to ensure that individuals have no more than a one-tenth chance per weekly draw.\n\nThe specific split between the three is not yet certain and will ultimately be left to Polkadot Governance to ratify, but it is expected that no more than one-third will be used for the first two pots.\n\n### Individuality\n\nProject Individuality, the technology allowing this user-acquisition and community-expansion initiative, makes no attempt to *identify* people; no identity documents, phone numbers, email addresses, card details or bank payments are required. We require no Web2 logins. True to Satoshi\u2019s ideal, it is maintained by nobody and everybody.\n\nProject Individuality leverages the latest ZK technology, audited and informed by the Web3 Foundation Cryptographic Research Team and used also by the JAM protocol. This allows us to credibly claim that users can stay anonymous as they use various different applications and services on Polkadot. Every different application which a user uses is done with an unlinkable alias, and their different aliases are known only to the users themselves.\n\nThe first two *Decentralised Individuality Mechanisms* (that is, autonomous logic for ensuring that it is hard and costly for one person to appear as many, abbreviated DIMs) are in the final stages of testing and optimisation and will both launch in quick succession in the coming months. These are called Proof-of-Ink (PoI) and Proof-of-Video-Interaction (PoVI). Under Polkadot People Chain, DIMs are managed by Polkadot Governance and open to anyone to augment. Parity is planning to submit to the community, a third and fourth in the months following in line with the Polkadot People ideals of privacy (no need to give up any personal information), universality (like fungibility, the same for everyone everywhere regardless of social connectivity), transparency (anyone can rationalise anyone else\u2019s status) and resilience (against a rational, well-capitalised but finitely resourced bad actor).\n\nWhile PoI was already summarised in Gavin Wood\u2019s 2024 Web3 Summit presentation, PoVI has yet to be described. It offers a route to recognition of individuality for those for whom PoI seems like too big of a step. It involves spending 5 minutes per week playing a simple, silent game with 15 other people in a multi-person, globally synchronised, video call. The game is great fun, engaging and very, very easy.\n\n### Strategy\n\nIn order to maximise the long-term effectiveness of this campaign, it forms part of a wider strategy involving additional initiatives:\n\nFirstly high-quality, mass-market promotional material to draw attention to the giveaway and ensure that people around the world understand the proposition and entry. Parity and Web3 Foundation personnel familiar with the technology and proposition behind Polkadot People will be communicating over the coming days, weeks and months in various places and formats to help community members understand and advocate. There is some potential for professional material and mainstream distribution channels to be used.\n\nSecondly, Polkadot Staking protocol integration to help both increase Polkadot\u2019s security and reduce effective costs of Polkadot. This \u201cPolkadot New Deal\u201d means a path of providing fair economic benefits indefinitely to all those individuals helping Polkadot\u2019s security interests. Polkadot gets much cheaper security and, in turn, is able to limit its overall supply and end inflation. People get free rewards and services in exchange for a few well-chosen taps on a mobile device. This helps make DOT a crypto finally in Satoshi\u2019s vision: *Individuals systematically helping maintain the system and getting a fair share of a limited pie*.\n\nThirdly, full integration into the overall Polkadot System. Aside from being used under the redesigned Polkadot Staking protocol, this can also be used to help democratise Polkadot governance. A successful Polkadot People could be served by a separate treasury under a one-person-one-vote scheme or be used to introduce secure quadratic voting. Individuals tending to vote for proposals which are ultimately deemed successful by all could be rewarded with greater voting power in future votes. In due course Polkadot OpenGov can become Polkadot FutaGov.\n\nFourth, full integration into Polkadot Hub: As Hub takes its place as a compliment to Polkadot Parachains for the decentralised application development it will enable far more people to develop far more prototypes far faster. But Hub developers must be given more than just the usual smart-contract infrastructure if there is a\u00a0 serious expectation that this strategy will reinstall Polkadot as the recognised leading innovator. The big Web2 firms know that users like free services and free services can only be delivered with sybil resistance. Polkadot should give all Polkadot users zero cost transfers: send $50 to a friend and they receive that $50, not $49.98. Indeed this issue is far more serious when money is involved. Full Individuality integration into Polkadot\u2019s high-capacity Logic Collider which is Polkadot Hub will allow the fruits of this campaign to be leveraged to maximal economic impact.\n\nFifth, seamless integration into not only the native Polkadot mobile app but also other fully supported gateways. For any service expected to be popular, accessibility is crucial whether it is web, desktop or mobile. To maximise Polkadot\u2019s audience there will be people working hard to ensure a fluid and joyous user experience regardless of the platform.\n\n### Comparison and Perspective\n\nHowever large $3m might seem, two things must be held in mind:\n\nFirstly this is given to people to bring them into daily - and real - use of the Polkadot app. Unlike basically all user-acquisition proposals thus far in OpenGov, not a single dollar goes to middlemen and the users deal only with Polkadot. At the 1 million people level, this amount of funding would provide a scratchcard-like chance for everyone to win $250 per week as well as a few dollars extra per week for some mindful swiping.\n\nSecond, after the coming proposal to upgrade the Polkadot Staking protocol, the incentives can increase as funds beyond those used to compensate validators are used to spur validator decentralisation via Polkadot People voting. Even at $50m/year - merely one tenth of the amount Polkadot spent on security in 2024 - Polkadot could, as a hypothetical comparison, afford to give similar incentives to every voter in England.",

            "content": "## **Polkadot People Initiative: Incentives for Mass Polkadot Activation Campaign**\n\n### &#xA;**Proponent:**&#x20;\n\nPolkadot People System Chain (1rqM48LQVgWAsqgk35WqUVoqwQ7wyBf19Lkh3T4DeMvmmkE)\n\n**Requested funds:**\u00a0\n\nUSDT: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nUSDC: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nTotal: $3,009,600 these funds will be swapped to HOLLAR via DCA over 10 days.\n\n\n**Context:**\n\nSoon to be unveiled, Parity Technologies has spent 3 years designing and developing a Polkadot-native Proof-of-Personhood system. Project Individuality is autonomous logic which provides strong sybil-resistance worthy of our nascent Agentic Society. Sitting on the *Polkadot People* chain it is under Polkadot Governance and will be seamlessly integrated into both the upcoming Polkadot mobile application as well as Polkadot Hub. It is based on open standards and APIs and third-party integration is welcomed.\n\nThis specific proposal is to fund a massive Polkadot Induction campaign: the Fairest Airdrop ever and giving meaningful amounts to people outside of not only the Polkadot community but also outside of the wider crypto community. **No existing tokens, accounts or wallets are needed to take part.** The funding includes long-term incentives to ensure that our newcomers are retained within the Polkadot ecosystem as contributors to our wider services and success. Project Individuality, as new technology, can facilitate this campaign in a way unimaginable before.\n\nPolkadot needs a massive, technology-enabled, decentralised and secure incentivised user induction programme. These funds will be used for that incentive. Autonomous, on-chain logic will control and disbursement of these funds. **Neither Parity nor any other ecosystem entity has any role or authority in disbursement nor any operational function or privilege**. This logic will be in line with what is written here, reviewed and manifested by the standard Polkadot Governance apparatus and audited externally as is standard for system code.\n\n### The Spend\n\nThe funds will be disbursed under three separate and fully autonomous incentive mechanisms:\n\nFirstly, remuneration for the initial user bootstrapping, seeking to ensure that those individuals who come fastest and commit most to Polkadot People face no economic downside (and in some cases a modest economic upside). Individuals to receive $200, $100 or $50, depending on how early they are.\n\nSecondly, a pot for the continuous funding, paid exclusively and fairly, to Polkadot users who are both active and useful within the new Polkadot Governance apparatus. Individuals to receive no more than around $10/week again depending on contributions as measured through some game-theoretically sound, autonomous and decentralised means.\n\nFinally, the majority of the funds will go to a weekly airdrop system, aiming to randomly disburse small sums of money globally to lucky Polkadot People in a well-promoted airdrop campaign. Prizes of around $250, with special monthly star prizes which are $2,500. We expect to give away around 140 prizes per week, limiting the number to ensure that individuals have no more than a one-tenth chance per weekly draw.\n\nThe specific split between the three is not yet certain and will ultimately be left to Polkadot Governance to ratify, but it is expected that no more than one-third will be used for the first two pots.\n\n### Individuality\n\nProject Individuality, the technology allowing this user-acquisition and community-expansion initiative, makes no attempt to *identify* people; no identity documents, phone numbers, email addresses, card details or bank payments are required. We require no Web2 logins. True to Satoshi\u2019s ideal, it is maintained by nobody and everybody.\n\nProject Individuality leverages the latest ZK technology, audited and informed by the Web3 Foundation Cryptographic Research Team and used also by the JAM protocol. This allows us to credibly claim that users can stay anonymous as they use various different applications and services on Polkadot. Every different application which a user uses is done with an unlinkable alias, and their different aliases are known only to the users themselves.\n\nThe first two *Decentralised Individuality Mechanisms* (that is, autonomous logic for ensuring that it is hard and costly for one person to appear as many, abbreviated DIMs) are in the final stages of testing and optimisation and will both launch in quick succession in the coming months. These are called Proof-of-Ink (PoI) and Proof-of-Video-Interaction (PoVI). Under Polkadot People Chain, DIMs are managed by Polkadot Governance and open to anyone to augment. Parity is planning to submit to the community, a third and fourth in the months following in line with the Polkadot People ideals of privacy (no need to give up any personal information), universality (like fungibility, the same for everyone everywhere regardless of social connectivity), transparency (anyone can rationalise anyone else\u2019s status) and resilience (against a rational, well-capitalised but finitely resourced bad actor).\n\nWhile PoI was already summarised in Gavin Wood\u2019s 2024 Web3 Summit presentation, PoVI has yet to be described. It offers a route to recognition of individuality for those for whom PoI seems like too big of a step. It involves spending 5 minutes per week playing a simple, silent game with 15 other people in a multi-person, globally synchronised, video call. The game is great fun, engaging and very, very easy.\n\n### Strategy\n\nIn order to maximise the long-term effectiveness of this campaign, it forms part of a wider strategy involving additional initiatives:\n\nFirstly high-quality, mass-market promotional material to draw attention to the giveaway and ensure that people around the world understand the proposition and entry. Parity and Web3 Foundation personnel familiar with the technology and proposition behind Polkadot People will be communicating over the coming days, weeks and months in various places and formats to help community members understand and advocate. There is some potential for professional material and mainstream distribution channels to be used.\n\nSecondly, Polkadot Staking protocol integration to help both increase Polkadot\u2019s security and reduce effective costs of Polkadot. This \u201cPolkadot New Deal\u201d means a path of providing fair economic benefits indefinitely to all those individuals helping Polkadot\u2019s security interests. Polkadot gets much cheaper security and, in turn, is able to limit its overall supply and end inflation. People get free rewards and services in exchange for a few well-chosen taps on a mobile device. This helps make DOT a crypto finally in Satoshi\u2019s vision: *Individuals systematically helping maintain the system and getting a fair share of a limited pie*.\n\nThirdly, full integration into the overall Polkadot System. Aside from being used under the redesigned Polkadot Staking protocol, this can also be used to help democratise Polkadot governance. A successful Polkadot People could be served by a separate treasury under a one-person-one-vote scheme or be used to introduce secure quadratic voting. Individuals tending to vote for proposals which are ultimately deemed successful by all could be rewarded with greater voting power in future votes. In due course Polkadot OpenGov can become Polkadot FutaGov.\n\nFourth, full integration into Polkadot Hub: As Hub takes its place as a compliment to Polkadot Parachains for the decentralised application development it will enable far more people to develop far more prototypes far faster. But Hub developers must be given more than just the usual smart-contract infrastructure if there is a\u00a0 serious expectation that this strategy will reinstall Polkadot as the recognised leading innovator. The big Web2 firms know that users like free services and free services can only be delivered with sybil resistance. Polkadot should give all Polkadot users zero cost transfers: send $50 to a friend and they receive that $50, not $49.98. Indeed this issue is far more serious when money is involved. Full Individuality integration into Polkadot\u2019s high-capacity Logic Collider which is Polkadot Hub will allow the fruits of this campaign to be leveraged to maximal economic impact.\n\nFifth, seamless integration into not only the native Polkadot mobile app but also other fully supported gateways. For any service expected to be popular, accessibility is crucial whether it is web, desktop or mobile. To maximise Polkadot\u2019s audience there will be people working hard to ensure a fluid and joyous user experience regardless of the platform.\n\n### Comparison and Perspective\n\nHowever large $3m might seem, two things must be held in mind:\n\nFirstly this is given to people to bring them into daily - and real - use of the Polkadot app. Unlike basically all user-acquisition proposals thus far in OpenGov, not a single dollar goes to middlemen and the users deal only with Polkadot. At the 1 million people level, this amount of funding would provide a scratchcard-like chance for everyone to win $250 per week as well as a few dollars extra per week for some mindful swiping.\n\nSecond, after the coming proposal to upgrade the Polkadot Staking protocol, the incentives can increase as funds beyond those used to compensate validators are used to spur validator decentralisation via Polkadot People voting. Even at $50m/year - merely one tenth of the amount Polkadot spent on security in 2024 - Polkadot could, as a hypothetical comparison, afford to give similar incentives to every voter in England.",

Overview**\n\n## **1.1 Proposal Details**\n\n**Proponents:** Ross Bulat and Joel Kenny\n**Beneficiary Address:** 12zhXsqUgXp6roXoQvy5XbV5Qw2NpGqha66HuZLkAECNw1qs\n**Requested Amount:** $154,000 USDC\n**Funding Period**: November 2025 to July 2026 (9 months)\n**Track:** Medium Spender\n\nThe full details of our proposal can be viewed here: [**Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fe_z5K8NXDKBryYYGK-pqwdYffJmhmVPIdJr8SYqQQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAdditional discussion relating to this proposal: [**Polkadot Forum**](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/keep-the-staking-dashboard-growing-your-flagship-gateway-to-staking-defi/15555).\n\n## 1.2 Project Summary\n\nWe are pleased to present our proposal for continued development of the Polkadot Staking Dashboard for November 2025 - July 2026. Having successfully completed our previous milestones (verified via OG Tracker) and incorporated valuable community feedback following the completion of our last successful proposal in March 2025, we have strategically adjusted our deliverables to make the Staking Dashboard more dynamic and offer greater variety to meet the evolving needs of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n#### **Key points for this proposal:**\n\n* 9-month timeframe to accommodate expanded scope including integration of DeFi features\n* Enhanced feature diversity responding to community feedback for a more comprehensive staking and DeFi experience across rollups\n* Expanded development roadmap targeting user experience, critical network upgrades, and DeFi ecosystem integration\n* Funding requested in USDC stablecoin per community preference\n* Continued commitment to open-source development and community engagement\n* Previous 6-month cycles proved tight for complex features, while extending beyond 9 months reduces treasury flexibility. This duration allows proper DeFi integration research, testing, and iteration while maintaining regular community updates.\n\n## 1.3 Previous Success Metrics\n\nOur team has consistently delivered on commitments:\n\n* **Launched Staking Dashboard 2.0 -** Complete API re-architecture with Dedot integration delivering faster performance and type-safe interactions \\[[<u>X Thread</u>](https://x.com/rossbulat/status/1935161401791889441), [<u>Polkadot Post</u>](https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1935778649544049025)]\n* **Launched a dedicated home for the Staking Dashboard at** [<u>**polkadot.cloud/stake**</u>](https://polkadot.cloud/stake), created with support from [<u>Flez</u>](https://x.com/iamflez), project lead for the new Polkadot.Cloud website development project\n* **AssetHub integration** **-** Support for Westend AssetHub already deployed, with infrastructure ready for Kusama/Polkadot deployment\n* **Feature parity maintained** across all supported networks with enhanced reliability through live RPC health monitoring\n* **Enhanced pool functionality** - Nomination pool invites and quicker one-click pool joining\n* **Advanced nomination management** - introduction of full screen interface, validator search and commission filters\n* **Staking API launch** - GraphQL plugin providing instant historical staking data\n* **Successful Dedot migration** - A flagship implementation of the next-generation Dedot API\n* **Multi-Language & Currency Support** - Offering a more localised Staking experience\n* **Active community support** via Discord and email channels\n* **Verified completion** tracked by OG Tracker ([<u>OG Tracker Website</u>](https://app.ogtracker.io/mediumSpender/1370?tab=progress))\n\n## **1.4 What This Means For Users**\n\n* **Expanded DeFi integration:** Liquid staking support, 2-day unbonding, transaction fee payments in stablecoins, expanded balances UI with transfer support, token swaps directly in the dashboard\n* **Gateway into Polkadot ecosystem:** With additional stablecoin and liquid staking derivative support directly in the dashboard, It can act as a powerful gateway into Polkadot DeFi.\n* **Easier staking:** Simpler interfaces for both direct staking and nomination pools\n* **Better rewards tracking:** Enhanced staking reward predictions and forecasts\n* **Mobile-friendly updates:** Improved experience on phones and tablets\n* **Expanded language support:** Adding new language translations to join existing support\n* **Faster loading times:** Technical improvements powered by our Staking API\n* **More secure staking:** Enhanced error prevention and user guidance\n* **Enhanced support:** Dedicated staking support via email and Discord channel for rapid assistance\n\n## **1.5 Why the Staking Dashboard**\n\n* **Primary desktop staking gateway**: tens of thousands of users rely on the dashboard as their main staking interface monthly\n* **Reference implementation for the ecosystem**: Many users who haven't adopted newer solutions still rely on Polkadot.js wallet integration with the Staking Dashboard, making it the trusted reference point for \"set and forget\" staking strategies\n* **Competitive advantage over alternatives**: Mobile wallets lack comprehensive analytics, staking on exchanges sacrifices decentralization, and native wallet staking offers limited feature sets compared to the dedicated staking interface\n* **Educational platform**: Users learn staking mechanics through hands-on experience with validator selection and nomination pools\n* **Accessibility bridge**: Simple mode onboards newcomers while advanced features serve power users\n* **Global reach**: Multi-language support and various supported fiat currencies remove barriers for international users\n* **Open-source ecosystem benefit**: Transparent development enables community contributions and third-party integrations\n* **Cost efficiency:** Compared to alternatives (grants to multiple projects or exchange partnerships), the Staking Dashboard delivers comprehensive functionality through a single, proven team at competitive rates\n* **Gateway to DeFi ecosystem**: Expanding beyond traditional staking to offer comprehensive DeFi access including liquid staking, cross-chain transfers, token swaps, and stablecoin support.\n\n# 2. Development Roadmap\n\n### 2.1 DeFi Integration\n\nStaking Dashboard\u2019s position as one of the most widely used Polkadot Dapps positions it to be an effective gateway into the Polkadot DeFi ecosystem. This proposal outlines plans to onboard critical DeFi features directly into the Staking Dashboard to provide a seamless experience for key tasks, such as:\n\n* Adding the ability to **pay for transaction fees in stablecoins** USDC and USDT, alongside any other coins that roll out during the proposal period\n* Expanding the balance interface to also include stablecoins\n* **Discovering an account\u2019s DOT** on other rollups and **transferring it back** to AssetHub to stake\n* Rolling out **liquid staking support** on Polkadot to increase yields amid the upcoming fixed supply cap\n* Adding\u00a0 **DOT / KSM / Stablecoin swaps** directly in the Staking Dashboard.\n\n#### Priority: High\n\n| No | Task                                                                             | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Approx ETA               |\n| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| 1  | Allow transaction fee payment in stablecoins and future supported tokens         | After the AssetHub migration, transaction fees can be paid in USDC and USDT stablecoins. Staking Dashboard will roll out support to pay in these currencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Month 8-9                |\n| 2  | Add cross-chain DOT transfer support via Paraspell SDK(Related issue)            | Dedot and ourselves are currently working with the Paraspell team to add Dedot API support to their XCM tools.

We envisage a solution whereby a user can split their staking portfolio into native DOT staking and liquid staking, depending on their risk appetite.\u00a0We would like to explore rolling out UI directly in the Staking Dashboard to support liquid staking, with Bifrost as our first protocol of interest. | Month 4-6                |\n| 5  | Add DOT / KSM / Stablecoin swap interface.                                       | Allowing swapping directly in Staking Dashboard will bring multiple benefits\\:Quick swapping for users if they want to pay for Tx fees in stablesQuick swapping for users who wish to quickly convert their DOT or KSM rewards into stablecoinsAllows stablecoins received from the treasury, fellowship, other DeFi yields to quickly be swapped to DOT or KSM to then stake.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Month 9                  |\n| 6  | Add 2-day unbonding support when deployed                                        | 2-day unbonding is an upcoming update to how unbonding happens, speeding up the time it takes to unlock your tokens from 28 days to potentially 2 days. We plan to support this feature with a dedicated UI as it is deployed, further complementing the DeFi focus of this proposal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Month 4-5(when deployed) |\n| 7  | Add staking reward predictions to reward charts                                  | With the inclusion of the Staking API, we now have the necessary infrastructure to analyse staking reward history and create a prediction model based on an account\u2019s staking reward performance. We plan to roll out reward predictions on a per-era basis and embed these predictions directly inside the current reward charts in the Staking Dashboard. Predictions can be toggled on and off.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Month 2                  |\n\n### **2.2 Core Maintenance & Protocol Adaptation**\n\n#### **Priority: Critical**\n\n| No | Task                                                                                             | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Approx ETA |\n| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 8  | Continue dependency updates to keep the codebase up to date.                                     | Critical to keep Staking Dashboard up to date using industry-standard dependencies as they are updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Weekly     |\n| 9  | Continued hosting of the dashboard on staking.polkadot.cloud.                                    | Continue serving as the primary staking interface for the Polkadot ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Ongoing\u00a0\u00a0  |\n| 10 | Continue management of the Staking Dashboard Discord channel and email support.                  | The launch of the Staking Dashboard Discord channel has been a resounding success.

By signing an authentication token with a Polkadot account, the user proves who they are, and notifications can be safely delivered to their Dashboard thereafter. | Month 8-9  |\n| 24 | Validator status page: Advanced mode feature     | A new page for validators to check their status and reward data, and carry out essential tasks like updating their blocked status and commission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Month 3-4  |\n\n### **2.7 Further Codebase Formalisation**\n\n#### **Priority: Medium**\n\n| No | Task                                                                                | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Approx ETA |\n| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 25 | Further codebase formalisation: Modularise page sections into re-usable components. | With the addition of Simple Mode and our ambitions to improve it, modules from one page now need to be used in more than one page. e.g. displaying reward graphs and metrics in the Overview page when Simple Mode is turned on. As a result of this requirement, there is an opportunity to formalise components at the page level, making entire modules re-usable.

Overview**\n\n## **1.1 Proposal Details**\n\n**Proponents:** Ross Bulat and Joel Kenny\n**Beneficiary Address:** 12zhXsqUgXp6roXoQvy5XbV5Qw2NpGqha66HuZLkAECNw1qs\n**Requested Amount:** $154,000 USDC\n**Funding Period**: November 2025 to July 2026 (9 months)\n**Track:** Medium Spender\n\nThe full details of our proposal can be viewed here: [**Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fe_z5K8NXDKBryYYGK-pqwdYffJmhmVPIdJr8SYqQQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAdditional discussion relating to this proposal: [**Polkadot Forum**](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/keep-the-staking-dashboard-growing-your-flagship-gateway-to-staking-defi/15555).\n\n## 1.2 Project Summary\n\nWe are pleased to present our proposal for continued development of the Polkadot Staking Dashboard for November 2025 - July 2026. Having successfully completed our previous milestones (verified via OG Tracker) and incorporated valuable community feedback following the completion of our last successful proposal in March 2025, we have strategically adjusted our deliverables to make the Staking Dashboard more dynamic and offer greater variety to meet the evolving needs of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n#### **Key points for this proposal:**\n\n* 9-month timeframe to accommodate expanded scope including integration of DeFi features\n* Enhanced feature diversity responding to community feedback for a more comprehensive staking and DeFi experience across rollups\n* Expanded development roadmap targeting user experience, critical network upgrades, and DeFi ecosystem integration\n* Funding requested in USDC stablecoin per community preference\n* Continued commitment to open-source development and community engagement\n* Previous 6-month cycles proved tight for complex features, while extending beyond 9 months reduces treasury flexibility. This duration allows proper DeFi integration research, testing, and iteration while maintaining regular community updates.\n\n## 1.3 Previous Success Metrics\n\nOur team has consistently delivered on commitments:\n\n* **Launched Staking Dashboard 2.0 -** Complete API re-architecture with Dedot integration delivering faster performance and type-safe interactions \\[[<u>X Thread</u>](https://x.com/rossbulat/status/1935161401791889441), [<u>Polkadot Post</u>](https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1935778649544049025)]\n* **Launched a dedicated home for the Staking Dashboard at** [<u>**polkadot.cloud/stake**</u>](https://polkadot.cloud/stake), created with support from [<u>Flez</u>](https://x.com/iamflez), project lead for the new Polkadot.Cloud website development project\n* **AssetHub integration** **-** Support for Westend AssetHub already deployed, with infrastructure ready for Kusama/Polkadot deployment\n* **Feature parity maintained** across all supported networks with enhanced reliability through live RPC health monitoring\n* **Enhanced pool functionality** - Nomination pool invites and quicker one-click pool joining\n* **Advanced nomination management** - introduction of full screen interface, validator search and commission filters\n* **Staking API launch** - GraphQL plugin providing instant historical staking data\n* **Successful Dedot migration** - A flagship implementation of the next-generation Dedot API\n* **Multi-Language & Currency Support** - Offering a more localised Staking experience\n* **Active community support** via Discord and email channels\n* **Verified completion** tracked by OG Tracker ([<u>OG Tracker Website</u>](https://app.ogtracker.io/mediumSpender/1370?tab=progress))\n\n## **1.4 What This Means For Users**\n\n* **Expanded DeFi integration:** Liquid staking support, 2-day unbonding, transaction fee payments in stablecoins, expanded balances UI with transfer support, token swaps directly in the dashboard\n* **Gateway into Polkadot ecosystem:** With additional stablecoin and liquid staking derivative support directly in the dashboard, It can act as a powerful gateway into Polkadot DeFi.\n* **Easier staking:** Simpler interfaces for both direct staking and nomination pools\n* **Better rewards tracking:** Enhanced staking reward predictions and forecasts\n* **Mobile-friendly updates:** Improved experience on phones and tablets\n* **Expanded language support:** Adding new language translations to join existing support\n* **Faster loading times:** Technical improvements powered by our Staking API\n* **More secure staking:** Enhanced error prevention and user guidance\n* **Enhanced support:** Dedicated staking support via email and Discord channel for rapid assistance\n\n## **1.5 Why the Staking Dashboard**\n\n* **Primary desktop staking gateway**: tens of thousands of users rely on the dashboard as their main staking interface monthly\n* **Reference implementation for the ecosystem**: Many users who haven't adopted newer solutions still rely on Polkadot.js wallet integration with the Staking Dashboard, making it the trusted reference point for \"set and forget\" staking strategies\n* **Competitive advantage over alternatives**: Mobile wallets lack comprehensive analytics, staking on exchanges sacrifices decentralization, and native wallet staking offers limited feature sets compared to the dedicated staking interface\n* **Educational platform**: Users learn staking mechanics through hands-on experience with validator selection and nomination pools\n* **Accessibility bridge**: Simple mode onboards newcomers while advanced features serve power users\n* **Global reach**: Multi-language support and various supported fiat currencies remove barriers for international users\n* **Open-source ecosystem benefit**: Transparent development enables community contributions and third-party integrations\n* **Cost efficiency:** Compared to alternatives (grants to multiple projects or exchange partnerships), the Staking Dashboard delivers comprehensive functionality through a single, proven team at competitive rates\n* **Gateway to DeFi ecosystem**: Expanding beyond traditional staking to offer comprehensive DeFi access including liquid staking, cross-chain transfers, token swaps, and stablecoin support.\n\n# 2. Development Roadmap\n\n### 2.1 DeFi Integration\n\nStaking Dashboard\u2019s position as one of the most widely used Polkadot Dapps positions it to be an effective gateway into the Polkadot DeFi ecosystem.

By signing an authentication token with a Polkadot account, the user proves who they are, and notifications can be safely delivered to their Dashboard thereafter. | Month 8-9  |\n| 24 | Validator status page: Advanced mode feature     | A new page for validators to check their status and reward data, and carry out essential tasks like updating their blocked status and commission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Month 3-4  |\n\n### **2.7 Further Codebase Formalisation**\n\n#### **Priority: Medium**\n\n| No | Task                                                                                | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Approx ETA |\n| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 25 | Further codebase formalisation: Modularise page sections into re-usable components. | With the addition of Simple Mode and our ambitions to improve it, modules from one page now need to be used in more than one page. e.g. displaying reward graphs and metrics in the Overview page when Simple Mode is turned on. As a result of this requirement, there is an opportunity to formalise components at the page level, making entire modules re-usable.

Overview**\n\n## **1.1 Proposal Details**\n\n**Proponents:** Ross Bulat and Joel Kenny\n**Beneficiary Address:** 12zhXsqUgXp6roXoQvy5XbV5Qw2NpGqha66HuZLkAECNw1qs\n**Requested Amount:** $154,000 USDC\n**Funding Period**: November 2025 to July 2026 (9 months)\n**Track:** Medium Spender\n\nThe full details of our proposal can be viewed here: [**Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fe_z5K8NXDKBryYYGK-pqwdYffJmhmVPIdJr8SYqQQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAdditional discussion relating to this proposal: [**Polkadot Forum**](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/keep-the-staking-dashboard-growing-your-flagship-gateway-to-staking-defi/15555).\n\n## 1.2 Project Summary\n\nWe are pleased to present our proposal for continued development of the Polkadot Staking Dashboard for November 2025 - July 2026. Having successfully completed our previous milestones (verified via OG Tracker) and incorporated valuable community feedback following the completion of our last successful proposal in March 2025, we have strategically adjusted our deliverables to make the Staking Dashboard more dynamic and offer greater variety to meet the evolving needs of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n#### **Key points for this proposal:**\n\n* 9-month timeframe to accommodate expanded scope including integration of DeFi features\n* Enhanced feature diversity responding to community feedback for a more comprehensive staking and DeFi experience across rollups\n* Expanded development roadmap targeting user experience, critical network upgrades, and DeFi ecosystem integration\n* Funding requested in USDC stablecoin per community preference\n* Continued commitment to open-source development and community engagement\n* Previous 6-month cycles proved tight for complex features, while extending beyond 9 months reduces treasury flexibility. This duration allows proper DeFi integration research, testing, and iteration while maintaining regular community updates.\n\n## 1.3 Previous Success Metrics\n\nOur team has consistently delivered on commitments:\n\n* **Launched Staking Dashboard 2.0 -** Complete API re-architecture with Dedot integration delivering faster performance and type-safe interactions \\[[<u>X Thread</u>](https://x.com/rossbulat/status/1935161401791889441), [<u>Polkadot Post</u>](https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1935778649544049025)]\n* **Launched a dedicated home for the Staking Dashboard at** [<u>**polkadot.cloud/stake**</u>](https://polkadot.cloud/stake), created with support from [<u>Flez</u>](https://x.com/iamflez), project lead for the new Polkadot.Cloud website development project\n* **AssetHub integration** **-** Support for Westend AssetHub already deployed, with infrastructure ready for Kusama/Polkadot deployment\n* **Feature parity maintained** across all supported networks with enhanced reliability through live RPC health monitoring\n* **Enhanced pool functionality** - Nomination pool invites and quicker one-click pool joining\n* **Advanced nomination management** - introduction of full screen interface, validator search and commission filters\n* **Staking API launch** - GraphQL plugin providing instant historical staking data\n* **Successful Dedot migration** - A flagship implementation of the next-generation Dedot API\n* **Multi-Language & Currency Support** - Offering a more localised Staking experience\n* **Active community support** via Discord and email channels\n* **Verified completion** tracked by OG Tracker ([<u>OG Tracker Website</u>](https://app.ogtracker.io/mediumSpender/1370?tab=progress))\n\n## **1.4 What This Means For Users**\n\n* **Expanded DeFi integration:** Liquid staking support, 2-day unbonding, transaction fee payments in stablecoins, expanded balances UI with transfer support, token swaps directly in the dashboard\n* **Gateway into Polkadot ecosystem:** With additional stablecoin and liquid staking derivative support directly in the dashboard, It can act as a powerful gateway into Polkadot DeFi.\n* **Easier staking:** Simpler interfaces for both direct staking and nomination pools\n* **Better rewards tracking:** Enhanced staking reward predictions and forecasts\n* **Mobile-friendly updates:** Improved experience on phones and tablets\n* **Expanded language support:** Adding new language translations to join existing support\n* **Faster loading times:** Technical improvements powered by our Staking API\n* **More secure staking:** Enhanced error prevention and user guidance\n* **Enhanced support:** Dedicated staking support via email and Discord channel for rapid assistance\n\n## **1.5 Why the Staking Dashboard**\n\n* **Primary desktop staking gateway**: tens of thousands of users rely on the dashboard as their main staking interface monthly\n* **Reference implementation for the ecosystem**: Many users who haven't adopted newer solutions still rely on Polkadot.js wallet integration with the Staking Dashboard, making it the trusted reference point for \"set and forget\" staking strategies\n* **Competitive advantage over alternatives**: Mobile wallets lack comprehensive analytics, staking on exchanges sacrifices decentralization, and native wallet staking offers limited feature sets compared to the dedicated staking interface\n* **Educational platform**: Users learn staking mechanics through hands-on experience with validator selection and nomination pools\n* **Accessibility bridge**: Simple mode onboards newcomers while advanced features serve power users\n* **Global reach**: Multi-language support and various supported fiat currencies remove barriers for international users\n* **Open-source ecosystem benefit**: Transparent development enables community contributions and third-party integrations\n* **Cost efficiency:** Compared to alternatives (grants to multiple projects or exchange partnerships), the Staking Dashboard delivers comprehensive functionality through a single, proven team at competitive rates\n* **Gateway to DeFi ecosystem**: Expanding beyond traditional staking to offer comprehensive DeFi access including liquid staking, cross-chain transfers, token swaps, and stablecoin support.\n\n# 2. Development Roadmap\n\n### 2.1 DeFi Integration\n\nStaking Dashboard\u2019s position as one of the most widely used Polkadot Dapps positions it to be an effective gateway into the Polkadot DeFi ecosystem.

By signing an authentication token with a Polkadot account, the user proves who they are, and notifications can be safely delivered to their Dashboard thereafter. | Month 8-9  |\n| 24 | Validator status page: Advanced mode feature     | A new page for validators to check their status and reward data, and carry out essential tasks like updating their blocked status and commission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Month 3-4  |\n\n### **2.7 Further Codebase Formalisation**\n\n#### **Priority: Medium**\n\n| No | Task                                                                                | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Approx ETA |\n| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 25 | Further codebase formalisation: Modularise page sections into re-usable components. | With the addition of Simple Mode and our ambitions to improve it, modules from one page now need to be used in more than one page. e.g. displaying reward graphs and metrics in the Overview page when Simple Mode is turned on. As a result of this requirement, there is an opportunity to formalise components at the page level, making entire modules re-usable.

Summary\n\nThe Polkadot Staking Dashboard has established itself as essential infrastructure for the ecosystem. This expanded 9-month proposal, shaped by valuable community feedback, ensures continued excellence while introducing meaningful improvements that benefit both new and experienced stakers. The extended timeline and expanded scope reflect our commitment to delivering a more dynamic and feature-rich platform that extends beyond traditional staking to embrace the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWith a proven track record, experienced team, and clear deliverables, we are confident in delivering significant value to the Polkadot community. The requested funding represents efficient allocation for maintaining and enhancing critical ecosystem infrastructure while expanding its capabilities to meet the evolving needs of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nShould this proposal not pass, we remain committed to the dashboard as critical infrastructure. We will continue maintaining core functionality while seeking alternative sustainable funding models, though the expanded DeFi integration and advanced features outlined here would be delayed or unfeasible without treasury support.\n\n*Questions?

Recent activity: https://github.com/tien?tab=overview\n\n## Current adoption\n\nNoteworthy projects that I am aware of:\n\n- [create-polkadot-dapp](https://github.com/paritytech/create-polkadot-dapp)\n- [inkathon](https://inkathon.xyz/)\n- [Mentatminds](https://mentatminds.com/)\n- [Multix](https://multix.cloud/)\n- [Polkadot-UI](https://polkadot-ui.com/)\n- [Delegit](https://delegit.xyz/)\n- [pop-wallet-signing-portal](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-wallet-signing-portal)\n- And possibly more\n\nWeekly downloads: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactive-dot/core\n\n## Proposed works\n\nAs the feature set has now reached a stage where it meets the level of quality and completeness I personally set out to achieve, I'll be shifting my effort more toward **increasing adoption** and taking on **DevRel**.\n\nThis means a part\u2011time commitment of approximately **3 hours per day**. During that time I will:\n\n- refine and improve documentation and onboarding materials;\n- assist projects integrating ReactiveDOT and related tools;\n- stay responsive to community questions and fix issues promptly;\n- maintain CI/CD pipelines and general upkeep.\n- and of course develop any features on request\n\nThis schedule allows me to use my remaining time to explore other areas of contribution within the Polkadot ecosystem while maintaining the same high standard that I have in previous proposals: I always aim to push boundaries, not replicate or create busywork.\n\nIt will also help me gradually reduce dependency on the Treasury, sentiment is currently low, while still staying within Polkadot. Ultimately, I will wait for developments around **Polkadot Hub** before deciding on the most viable paths forward.\n\n## Requested budget\n\n<table>\n  <caption>3 months duration: November 2025 to January 2026</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Personnel</th>\n      <th>Rate</th>\n      <th>Tasks</th>\n      <th>Time</th>\n      <th>Cost</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">Tien (myself)</td>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">$125/hour</td>\n      <td>Development based on feature requests</td>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">198 hours</td>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">$24,750</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bug fixes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Improve documentation & onboarding materials</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>CI/CD maintenance</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Support via GitHub issues, DMs & dedicated Matrix channel</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Outreach & promotion</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n",

            "content": "## **Polkadot People Initiative: Incentives for Mass Polkadot Activation Campaign**\n\n### &#xA;**Proponent:**&#x20;\n\nPolkadot People System Chain (1rqM48LQVgWAsqgk35WqUVoqwQ7wyBf19Lkh3T4DeMvmmkE)\n\n**Requested funds:**\u00a0\n\nUSDT: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nUSDC: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nTotal: $3,009,600 these funds will be swapped to HOLLAR via DCA over 10 days.\n\n\n**Context:**\n\nSoon to be unveiled, Parity Technologies has spent 3 years designing and developing a Polkadot-native Proof-of-Personhood system. Project Individuality is autonomous logic which provides strong sybil-resistance worthy of our nascent Agentic Society. Sitting on the *Polkadot People* chain it is under Polkadot Governance and will be seamlessly integrated into both the upcoming Polkadot mobile application as well as Polkadot Hub. It is based on open standards and APIs and third-party integration is welcomed.\n\nThis specific proposal is to fund a massive Polkadot Induction campaign: the Fairest Airdrop ever and giving meaningful amounts to people outside of not only the Polkadot community but also outside of the wider crypto community. **No existing tokens, accounts or wallets are needed to take part.** The funding includes long-term incentives to ensure that our newcomers are retained within the Polkadot ecosystem as contributors to our wider services and success. Project Individuality, as new technology, can facilitate this campaign in a way unimaginable before.\n\nPolkadot needs a massive, technology-enabled, decentralised and secure incentivised user induction programme. These funds will be used for that incentive. Autonomous, on-chain logic will control and disbursement of these funds. **Neither Parity nor any other ecosystem entity has any role or authority in disbursement nor any operational function or privilege**. This logic will be in line with what is written here, reviewed and manifested by the standard Polkadot Governance apparatus and audited externally as is standard for system code.\n\n### The Spend\n\nThe funds will be disbursed under three separate and fully autonomous incentive mechanisms:\n\nFirstly, remuneration for the initial user bootstrapping, seeking to ensure that those individuals who come fastest and commit most to Polkadot People face no economic downside (and in some cases a modest economic upside). Individuals to receive $200, $100 or $50, depending on how early they are.\n\nSecondly, a pot for the continuous funding, paid exclusively and fairly, to Polkadot users who are both active and useful within the new Polkadot Governance apparatus. Individuals to receive no more than around $10/week again depending on contributions as measured through some game-theoretically sound, autonomous and decentralised means.\n\nFinally, the majority of the funds will go to a weekly airdrop system, aiming to randomly disburse small sums of money globally to lucky Polkadot People in a well-promoted airdrop campaign. Prizes of around $250, with special monthly star prizes which are $2,500. We expect to give away around 140 prizes per week, limiting the number to ensure that individuals have no more than a one-tenth chance per weekly draw.\n\nThe specific split between the three is not yet certain and will ultimately be left to Polkadot Governance to ratify, but it is expected that no more than one-third will be used for the first two pots.\n\n### Individuality\n\nProject Individuality, the technology allowing this user-acquisition and community-expansion initiative, makes no attempt to *identify* people; no identity documents, phone numbers, email addresses, card details or bank payments are required. We require no Web2 logins. True to Satoshi\u2019s ideal, it is maintained by nobody and everybody.\n\nProject Individuality leverages the latest ZK technology, audited and informed by the Web3 Foundation Cryptographic Research Team and used also by the JAM protocol. This allows us to credibly claim that users can stay anonymous as they use various different applications and services on Polkadot. Every different application which a user uses is done with an unlinkable alias, and their different aliases are known only to the users themselves.\n\nThe first two *Decentralised Individuality Mechanisms* (that is, autonomous logic for ensuring that it is hard and costly for one person to appear as many, abbreviated DIMs) are in the final stages of testing and optimisation and will both launch in quick succession in the coming months. These are called Proof-of-Ink (PoI) and Proof-of-Video-Interaction (PoVI). Under Polkadot People Chain, DIMs are managed by Polkadot Governance and open to anyone to augment. Parity is planning to submit to the community, a third and fourth in the months following in line with the Polkadot People ideals of privacy (no need to give up any personal information), universality (like fungibility, the same for everyone everywhere regardless of social connectivity), transparency (anyone can rationalise anyone else\u2019s status) and resilience (against a rational, well-capitalised but finitely resourced bad actor).\n\nWhile PoI was already summarised in Gavin Wood\u2019s 2024 Web3 Summit presentation, PoVI has yet to be described. It offers a route to recognition of individuality for those for whom PoI seems like too big of a step. It involves spending 5 minutes per week playing a simple, silent game with 15 other people in a multi-person, globally synchronised, video call. The game is great fun, engaging and very, very easy.\n\n### Strategy\n\nIn order to maximise the long-term effectiveness of this campaign, it forms part of a wider strategy involving additional initiatives:\n\nFirstly high-quality, mass-market promotional material to draw attention to the giveaway and ensure that people around the world understand the proposition and entry. Parity and Web3 Foundation personnel familiar with the technology and proposition behind Polkadot People will be communicating over the coming days, weeks and months in various places and formats to help community members understand and advocate. There is some potential for professional material and mainstream distribution channels to be used.\n\nSecondly, Polkadot Staking protocol integration to help both increase Polkadot\u2019s security and reduce effective costs of Polkadot. This \u201cPolkadot New Deal\u201d means a path of providing fair economic benefits indefinitely to all those individuals helping Polkadot\u2019s security interests. Polkadot gets much cheaper security and, in turn, is able to limit its overall supply and end inflation. People get free rewards and services in exchange for a few well-chosen taps on a mobile device. This helps make DOT a crypto finally in Satoshi\u2019s vision: *Individuals systematically helping maintain the system and getting a fair share of a limited pie*.\n\nThirdly, full integration into the overall Polkadot System. Aside from being used under the redesigned Polkadot Staking protocol, this can also be used to help democratise Polkadot governance. A successful Polkadot People could be served by a separate treasury under a one-person-one-vote scheme or be used to introduce secure quadratic voting. Individuals tending to vote for proposals which are ultimately deemed successful by all could be rewarded with greater voting power in future votes. In due course Polkadot OpenGov can become Polkadot FutaGov.\n\nFourth, full integration into Polkadot Hub: As Hub takes its place as a compliment to Polkadot Parachains for the decentralised application development it will enable far more people to develop far more prototypes far faster. But Hub developers must be given more than just the usual smart-contract infrastructure if there is a\u00a0 serious expectation that this strategy will reinstall Polkadot as the recognised leading innovator. The big Web2 firms know that users like free services and free services can only be delivered with sybil resistance.

Full Individuality integration into Polkadot\u2019s high-capacity Logic Collider which is Polkadot Hub will allow the fruits of this campaign to be leveraged to maximal economic impact.\n\nFifth, seamless integration into not only the native Polkadot mobile app but also other fully supported gateways. For any service expected to be popular, accessibility is crucial whether it is web, desktop or mobile. To maximise Polkadot\u2019s audience there will be people working hard to ensure a fluid and joyous user experience regardless of the platform.\n\n### Comparison and Perspective\n\nHowever large $3m might seem, two things must be held in mind:\n\nFirstly this is given to people to bring them into daily - and real - use of the Polkadot app. Unlike basically all user-acquisition proposals thus far in OpenGov, not a single dollar goes to middlemen and the users deal only with Polkadot. At the 1 million people level, this amount of funding would provide a scratchcard-like chance for everyone to win $250 per week as well as a few dollars extra per week for some mindful swiping.\n\nSecond, after the coming proposal to upgrade the Polkadot Staking protocol, the incentives can increase as funds beyond those used to compensate validators are used to spur validator decentralisation via Polkadot People voting. Even at $50m/year - merely one tenth of the amount Polkadot spent on security in 2024 - Polkadot could, as a hypothetical comparison, afford to give similar incentives to every voter in England.",

            "content": "## **Polkadot People Initiative: Incentives for Mass Polkadot Activation Campaign**\n\n### &#xA;**Proponent:**&#x20;\n\nPolkadot People System Chain (1rqM48LQVgWAsqgk35WqUVoqwQ7wyBf19Lkh3T4DeMvmmkE)\n\n**Requested funds:**\u00a0\n\nUSDT: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nUSDC: $1,504,800 + $200 for fees&#x20;\nTotal: $3,009,600 these funds will be swapped to HOLLAR via DCA over 10 days.\n\n\n**Context:**\n\nSoon to be unveiled, Parity Technologies has spent 3 years designing and developing a Polkadot-native Proof-of-Personhood system. Project Individuality is autonomous logic which provides strong sybil-resistance worthy of our nascent Agentic Society. Sitting on the *Polkadot People* chain it is under Polkadot Governance and will be seamlessly integrated into both the upcoming Polkadot mobile application as well as Polkadot Hub. It is based on open standards and APIs and third-party integration is welcomed.\n\nThis specific proposal is to fund a massive Polkadot Induction campaign: the Fairest Airdrop ever and giving meaningful amounts to people outside of not only the Polkadot community but also outside of the wider crypto community. **No existing tokens, accounts or wallets are needed to take part.** The funding includes long-term incentives to ensure that our newcomers are retained within the Polkadot ecosystem as contributors to our wider services and success. Project Individuality, as new technology, can facilitate this campaign in a way unimaginable before.\n\nPolkadot needs a massive, technology-enabled, decentralised and secure incentivised user induction programme. These funds will be used for that incentive. Autonomous, on-chain logic will control and disbursement of these funds. **Neither Parity nor any other ecosystem entity has any role or authority in disbursement nor any operational function or privilege**. This logic will be in line with what is written here, reviewed and manifested by the standard Polkadot Governance apparatus and audited externally as is standard for system code.\n\n### The Spend\n\nThe funds will be disbursed under three separate and fully autonomous incentive mechanisms:\n\nFirstly, remuneration for the initial user bootstrapping, seeking to ensure that those individuals who come fastest and commit most to Polkadot People face no economic downside (and in some cases a modest economic upside). Individuals to receive $200, $100 or $50, depending on how early they are.\n\nSecondly, a pot for the continuous funding, paid exclusively and fairly, to Polkadot users who are both active and useful within the new Polkadot Governance apparatus. Individuals to receive no more than around $10/week again depending on contributions as measured through some game-theoretically sound, autonomous and decentralised means.\n\nFinally, the majority of the funds will go to a weekly airdrop system, aiming to randomly disburse small sums of money globally to lucky Polkadot People in a well-promoted airdrop campaign. Prizes of around $250, with special monthly star prizes which are $2,500. We expect to give away around 140 prizes per week, limiting the number to ensure that individuals have no more than a one-tenth chance per weekly draw.\n\nThe specific split between the three is not yet certain and will ultimately be left to Polkadot Governance to ratify, but it is expected that no more than one-third will be used for the first two pots.\n\n### Individuality\n\nProject Individuality, the technology allowing this user-acquisition and community-expansion initiative, makes no attempt to *identify* people; no identity documents, phone numbers, email addresses, card details or bank payments are required. We require no Web2 logins. True to Satoshi\u2019s ideal, it is maintained by nobody and everybody.\n\nProject Individuality leverages the latest ZK technology, audited and informed by the Web3 Foundation Cryptographic Research Team and used also by the JAM protocol. This allows us to credibly claim that users can stay anonymous as they use various different applications and services on Polkadot. Every different application which a user uses is done with an unlinkable alias, and their different aliases are known only to the users themselves.\n\nThe first two *Decentralised Individuality Mechanisms* (that is, autonomous logic for ensuring that it is hard and costly for one person to appear as many, abbreviated DIMs) are in the final stages of testing and optimisation and will both launch in quick succession in the coming months. These are called Proof-of-Ink (PoI) and Proof-of-Video-Interaction (PoVI). Under Polkadot People Chain, DIMs are managed by Polkadot Governance and open to anyone to augment. Parity is planning to submit to the community, a third and fourth in the months following in line with the Polkadot People ideals of privacy (no need to give up any personal information), universality (like fungibility, the same for everyone everywhere regardless of social connectivity), transparency (anyone can rationalise anyone else\u2019s status) and resilience (against a rational, well-capitalised but finitely resourced bad actor).\n\nWhile PoI was already summarised in Gavin Wood\u2019s 2024 Web3 Summit presentation, PoVI has yet to be described. It offers a route to recognition of individuality for those for whom PoI seems like too big of a step. It involves spending 5 minutes per week playing a simple, silent game with 15 other people in a multi-person, globally synchronised, video call. The game is great fun, engaging and very, very easy.\n\n### Strategy\n\nIn order to maximise the long-term effectiveness of this campaign, it forms part of a wider strategy involving additional initiatives:\n\nFirstly high-quality, mass-market promotional material to draw attention to the giveaway and ensure that people around the world understand the proposition and entry. Parity and Web3 Foundation personnel familiar with the technology and proposition behind Polkadot People will be communicating over the coming days, weeks and months in various places and formats to help community members understand and advocate. There is some potential for professional material and mainstream distribution channels to be used.\n\nSecondly, Polkadot Staking protocol integration to help both increase Polkadot\u2019s security and reduce effective costs of Polkadot. This \u201cPolkadot New Deal\u201d means a path of providing fair economic benefits indefinitely to all those individuals helping Polkadot\u2019s security interests. Polkadot gets much cheaper security and, in turn, is able to limit its overall supply and end inflation. People get free rewards and services in exchange for a few well-chosen taps on a mobile device. This helps make DOT a crypto finally in Satoshi\u2019s vision: *Individuals systematically helping maintain the system and getting a fair share of a limited pie*.\n\nThirdly, full integration into the overall Polkadot System. Aside from being used under the redesigned Polkadot Staking protocol, this can also be used to help democratise Polkadot governance. A successful Polkadot People could be served by a separate treasury under a one-person-one-vote scheme or be used to introduce secure quadratic voting. Individuals tending to vote for proposals which are ultimately deemed successful by all could be rewarded with greater voting power in future votes. In due course Polkadot OpenGov can become Polkadot FutaGov.\n\nFourth, full integration into Polkadot Hub: As Hub takes its place as a compliment to Polkadot Parachains for the decentralised application development it will enable far more people to develop far more prototypes far faster. But Hub developers must be given more than just the usual smart-contract infrastructure if there is a\u00a0 serious expectation that this strategy will reinstall Polkadot as the recognised leading innovator. The big Web2 firms know that users like free services and free services can only be delivered with sybil resistance. Polkadot should give all Polkadot users zero cost transfers: send $50 to a friend and they receive that $50, not $49.98. Indeed this issue is far more serious when money is involved. Full Individuality integration into Polkadot\u2019s high-capacity Logic Collider which is Polkadot Hub will allow the fruits of this campaign to be leveraged to maximal economic impact.\n\nFifth, seamless integration into not only the native Polkadot mobile app but also other fully supported gateways. For any service expected to be popular, accessibility is crucial whether it is web, desktop or mobile. To maximise Polkadot\u2019s audience there will be people working hard to ensure a fluid and joyous user experience regardless of the platform.\n\n### Comparison and Perspective\n\nHowever large $3m might seem, two things must be held in mind:\n\nFirstly this is given to people to bring them into daily - and real - use of the Polkadot app. Unlike basically all user-acquisition proposals thus far in OpenGov, not a single dollar goes to middlemen and the users deal only with Polkadot.

Even at $50m/year - merely one tenth of the amount Polkadot spent on security in 2024 - Polkadot could, as a hypothetical comparison, afford to give similar incentives to every voter in England.",
